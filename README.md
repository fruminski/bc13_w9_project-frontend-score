#LiveAPI ~ frontend

Try it out here ----->[Live Api](https://live-api.netlify.app/)<------

LiveAPI is an app created to examine if API's are running successfully or if the API's are currently redundant. 

It's a result of a week-long project at School of Code by S.C.O.R.E. team of four.

The general idea of the app was generated by the team discussing issues we have been through throughout the bootcamp and what we can do to resolve it. 

Users can also add an API, delete an API, recieve links to the DOCS and also recieve data in a JSON file.
## Tech Stack 
What we used on the frontend consisted of:
```
React
Javascript
Css
```




## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
By doing this, users can have access to fully maximise the app itself

## Running Tests

As a group, we made several tests to make sure the code we wrote was running the way we wanted it to. By using Jest, Supertest and also React test libraby, we were able to see if it was running successuly or not.

To run tests, run the following command

```bash
  npm run test
```
